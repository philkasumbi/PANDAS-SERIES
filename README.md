# 📊 Learning Pandas: Data Analysis with Python

Welcome to my Pandas learning repository!  
This project showcases my practical journey with **Pandas**, the powerful data analysis library in Python. It includes hands-on exercises and examples that cover the most essential operations you'll need when working with real-world data.

## 🚀 Topics Covered

This repo includes my study and practice in the following areas:

### 📁 Reading Files
- Reading CSV, Excel, and text files into Pandas DataFrames.
- Exploring datasets using `.head()`, `.info()`, and `.describe()`.

### 🔍 Filtering and Ordering
- Using conditional logic to filter rows.
- Sorting data with `.sort_values()` and `.sort_index()`.

### 📌 Indexing
- Setting, resetting, and changing indexes.
- Label-based and position-based indexing using `.loc[]` and `.iloc[]`.

### 🧮 Group By and Aggregating
- Grouping data by categories using `.groupby()`.
- Aggregating with `.sum()`, `.mean()`, `.count()`, etc.
- Applying custom functions.

### 🔗 Merging, Joining, and Concatenating
- Combining datasets using `merge()`, `join()`, and `concat()`.
- Understanding different join types (inner, outer, left, right).

### 📈 Creating Visualizations
- Generating plots directly from Pandas using `.plot()`.
- Exploring data visually using bar charts, line graphs, and histograms.
